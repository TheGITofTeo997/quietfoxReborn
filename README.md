## Some Notes ‚ÑπÔ∏è
We are a group of two people that loved Quietfox. Unluckily Firefox updates have broken it over time, so our goal is to fix it and improve the look as much as possible, that's why we have this fork. 

We will keep supporting this project through the upcoming Firefox updates, however we can still consider this in beta so it's far from being perfect.

Most of the credits go to the original ![creator](https://github.com/k-amryn)

## The Goal ‚ÑπÔ∏è
This userChrome mod was created by the original creator to make the Firefox UI cleaner and more modern without sacrificing any of its original features. You can pretty much forget that you have a mod installed, it works *quietly* in the background. Our additional goal is to have a smoother and sleeker experience.

Here are some of the notable features:


## Customizable values 
Simply open userChrome.css in a text editor and change the values at the top of the file. Restart Firefox to see changes.

üí° Please note this is still in Beta and we had to "force" some values to prevent breakage, so you might *not* be able to tweak all.

### Customizations ‚ÑπÔ∏è

```CSS
/* -------------------- üé® Customization üé® -------------------- */
    --tab-corner-rounding: 7px;
    --button-corner-rounding: 7px;
    --menu-item-height: 35px;
    --animation-speed: 0.15s;
    --hovering-speed:300ms;
    --menu-corner-rounding: 7px;
    --icon-border-rounding: 10px;
    --button-hovered-corner-rounding:11px;
    --container-context-line-speed-animation:0.6s;

## Theme-adapted menus ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Quietfox will automatically pick the main color of your theme and will use it for popup menus! We've just been able to restore this functionality, so theme adapted menus are finally back. Please note not all kind of themes might be good to work (or easily readable), so pick your theme carefully and experiment what is better for you. We now also support the [Adaptive Tab Color extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adaptive-tab-bar-colour/) to bring in even more customization.

üí°Although a lot of effort is being put into this feature, we can't expect to support **all** the themes ever created, so some themes will simply **not** work. This feature is being actively worked on since we are trying to find the options that could fit most of the themes.

## Address bar buttons appear when needed ‚ÑπÔ∏è

## Smooth support for containerized tabs ‚ÑπÔ∏è

## Support for latest internal menus ‚ÑπÔ∏è
